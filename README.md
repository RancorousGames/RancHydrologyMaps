# RancHydrologyMaps

![Example](SampleHeightmaps/Demo.png)

RancHydrologyMaps is a C# library for generating realistic island terrain heightmaps for games and simulations using river propagation algorithms and noise functions. This library can be used to create unique and procedurally generated maps for various applications, including game development and GIS.
Features

* Generates randomized island terrain heightmaps
* Implements river propagation algorithms for realistic river systems
* Uses noise functions for natural-looking terrain
* Optimized performance using k-d trees for efficient nearest neighbor searches
* Flexible and modular design for easy integration into existing projects



## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

    .NET Framework or .NET Core

## Installation

Clone the repository:

bash
